    <center><h1>Bandeja Paisa</h1></center>
    <center><h3>The Paisa Tray is probably the most popular dish in Colombia, 
    it is originally from the Andean region of the country, where people are called 
    "Paisas" and the area where I was born and raised.</h3></center>

    <center><p>Paisa tray is something I have eaten all my life, and if I had to choose my last
             meal on this earth, this is the dish I would choose without a doubt.
             Traditionally, the Paisa Tray includes beans, white rice, pork rinds, meat powder,
            chorizo, fried egg, ripe plantain, avocado, and arepa, but you can substitute meat 
            powder for grilled beef or pork. I usually make the beans and ground beef the day 
            before to make the recipe easier.</p></center>
